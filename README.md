# AI-Powered Task Manager with Qt and Machine Learning
## Project Proposal

## Introduction
Managing tasks efficiently is crucial for productivity. This project introduces an **AI-powered Task Manager**, developed using C++ with Qt for the GUI and Python for AI integration. The system allows users to add, remove, and manage tasks through an intuitive interface while leveraging machine learning for intelligent task prioritization.

## Main Idea
The Task Manager combines a Qt-based graphical user interface (GUI) with a machine learning backend written in Python. Users can input tasks, and the system intelligently ranks them based on priority. By implementing Random Forest, the AI model will analyze task attributes such as deadline, urgency, category, and user history to recommend an optimized task order. This approach enhances productivity and decision-making.

## Main Features
1. **Task Manager with GUI (Qt in C++)**
2. **AI-Powered Task Prioritization (Random Forest in Python)**
3. **Voice Commands for Hands-Free Operation**

## Side Features (Recommendations for Future Work)
1. **Standalone App Deployment (.exe, .deb, etc.)**
2. **Cloud Storage Sync (Firebase)**

## Technical Details
The used Operating System is *Linux Ubuntu*:
- **Distributor ID**: Ubuntu
- **Description**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **Release**: 20.04
- **Codename**: focal

The estimated time for the main features is **30 days** and for the entire project is **45 days**.
